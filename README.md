# PhysicalPercPlugin
A physically-informed percussion synthesis audio plugin


Inspired by the similar standalone app, this is an effort to transfer the research carried out for the M.Sc. Acoustics & Music Technology
into a physically modelled percussion synth plugin. 

The UI for this is fully functional but the audio needs to be optimised and debugged.
This is a transfer of the standalone app into a VST plugin so naturally the audio configurations present very big diffences which need to be accounted for.
